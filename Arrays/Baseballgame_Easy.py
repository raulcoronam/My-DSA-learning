Baseball Game

You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record. 

Given a list of strings [operations], where operations[i] is the ith operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:

- An integer "x": Record a new score of "x"
- "+": Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores
- "D": Record a new score that is the double of the previous score
- "C": Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record

Return the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations. 

Note: The test cases are generated such that the answer and all intermediate calculations fi in a 32-bit integer and that all operations are valid. 

Example 1: 

Input: ops = ["1", "2, "+", "C", "5", "D"]

Output: 18
